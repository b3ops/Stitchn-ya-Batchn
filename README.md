FFmpeg is perfect for this—it's lightweight and handles video without needing Python. Assuming you have FFmpeg installed (e.g., via Homebrew on macOS: brew install ffmpeg, or apt on Linux: apt install ffmpeg).

Save this as extract_last_frame.sh, make it executable (chmod +x extract_last_frame.sh), and run ./extract_last_frame.sh input.mp4.

Generating New Videos with Grok ImagineUpload last_frame.jpg to Grok (on x.com or the app).
Prompt example: "Using this image as the starting frame, generate a 6-second animated video of [your scene description, e.g., 'a serene forest evolving at sunset with gentle wind']. Output as MP4."Grok Imagine (powered by Flux or similar) should handle image-to-video extension if available in 2025—aim for 6-sec clips to keep it snappy.

Repeat for variations: Generate 5-10 clips, each ~6 sec, based on evolving prompts (e.g., "Continue from previous: add raining effects").

Stitching 6-Second Videos into a Longer OneUse FFmpeg again—super simple for concat. Assume you have files like clip1.mp4, clip2.mp4, etc.

Run this bash command (or save as stitch_videos.sh):
